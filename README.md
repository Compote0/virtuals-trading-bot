# 🚀 Telegram Trading Bot for Virtuals on BASE

This bot is an **experimental** project built with Python, and uses the following libraries:
- pytelegrambotapi
- web3
- python-dotenv

## 🔍 Overview
This Telegram bot facilitates trading Virtual Tokens on the BASE blockchain. Although still under development (needs a DB and other things), the bot supports essential functionalities like:

- **💰 Wallet Creation**: Users can create and manage their wallets directly through the bot and see their addy + private key.
- **📊 Positions**: Users can see and manage their positions.
- **🛒 Token Purchases**: Users can purchase Virtual Tokens using ETH.
- **💸 Token Sales**: Users can sell Virtual Tokens to receive ETH.

## 📊 Current Status
The bot is operational but still a work in progress. Some advanced features are in development and will be released in future updates.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **🆕 Create a Wallet**: Use the bot to generate a secure wallet if you don't already have one.
2. **📥 Deposit ETH**: Send ETH to your wallet address generated by the bot.
3. **💸 Buy Virtual Tokens**: Execute token purchases through the bot interface. (Route (Uniswap) : ETH(base) -> Send 1% fee -> WETH -> Virtual Tokens -> Target Token)
4. **💱 Sell Virtual Tokens**: Sell tokens to receive ETH directly in your wallet. (Route (Uniswap) : Target Token -> Virtual Tokens -> WETH -> ETH)
5. **📊 View Positions**: Check your current positions and their details.
